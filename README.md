# Dog Identification Project
## Overview
This project focuses on dog identification using Deep Learning techniques. It utilizes image processing and machine learning to classify dog breeds based on input images.

## Features
* Image Preprocessing: Load and preprocess dog images for model training.
* Model Training: Train a CNN or pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet, VGG) for classification.
* Prediction & Evaluation: Identify dog breeds and evaluate model performance.

## Usage:
